## Runoff Quantity

$$

$$

## Runoff Volume

$$
V_i ​= Q_i ​* A_cell​
$$

Q = runoff per cell
A = cell area

$$
V_total​ = ∑V_i​
$$

## Runoff Velocity

#### Kinematic wave

$$
v=k*S^{0.5}
$$

k = land-cover-based roughness factor
S = local slope

#### Manning without channel geometry

$$
v = \frac{1}{n}h^{2/3}S^{1/2}
$$

Assumed shape, wide shallow flow

h = runoff depth (from rainfall excess)
n = surface roughness from land cover

##### cell-to-cell travel time

$$
t_i​= L_i/v_i​​
$$

L_i= flow path length (10 m or diagonal)

V_i= velocity from step 5
